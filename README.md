# Circuit-Breaker

For this project, Ioannis and Daniel collaborated and design a circuit breaker using LTspice and conducted testing on the circuit breaker using simulations and physical testing using a breadboard.

**Creation of circuit breaker:** When creating the circuit breaker the components that were used are an LM358 (Dual Package Op-amp), potentiometer, NPN transistor BC547, resistors, capacitors and an LED. Once the components that are required were determine creating on LTspice was the next step. As the images below show the LTspice circuit:

**Testing simulation:** Once the circuit was created on LTspice the next step was to run simulation testing on the circuit. As the images down below show the different types of testing that had occurred.



**Testing physical:**
